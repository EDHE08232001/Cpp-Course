An **inline function** in C++ is a function for which the compiler attempts to generate inline code instead of a regular function call. This means that, wherever the function is called, the function's code is directly substituted at the call site, eliminating the overhead associated with function calls (like pushing arguments onto the stack, jumping to the function code, and returning from the function).

### How to Define an Inline Function

To define an inline function in C++, you use the `inline` keyword before the function definition:

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Alternatively, you can define an inline function directly inside a class or a struct, which makes it implicitly inline:

```cpp
class Math {
public:
    inline int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};
```

### Benefits of Inline Functions

1. **Performance Improvement**: By substituting the function code directly at the call site, inline functions can reduce the overhead of function calls, which can be beneficial for small, frequently called functions.

2. **Compiler Optimization**: Inline functions can help the compiler optimize the code better, as the compiler has more information about the code and can apply more advanced optimizations.

3. **Reduced Function Call Overhead**: Eliminating function calls (e.g., no stack push/pop operations, no jump instructions) can be particularly advantageous in performance-critical code, such as loops or real-time systems.

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Code Bloat**: Inline functions can increase the size of the binary if they are large or called many times because the function's code is duplicated at every call site.

2. **Compiler Discretion**: The `inline` keyword is only a suggestion to the compiler. The compiler may choose not to inline a function if it determines that inlining would not be beneficial or would increase the code size excessively.

3. **Recursive Functions**: Recursive functions cannot generally be inlined, as inlining would require an infinite number of copies.

4. **Complex Functions**: Functions with complex control flow (loops, conditionals) or those that are too large may not be inlined by the compiler.

### Example of an Inline Function

```cpp
#include <iostream>

inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "Square of " << a << " is " << square(a) << std::endl; // The call to square() may be inlined here
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, the call to `square(a)` may be replaced with `a * a` directly at the call site by the compiler, avoiding a regular function call.

### When to Use Inline Functions

- **Small Functions**: Use inline functions for small, frequently called functions where the overhead of a function call is noticeable.
- **Simple Functions**: Functions that are simple and have a straightforward return statement or a small amount of code.
- **Performance-Critical Code**: When you want to minimize function call overhead in performance-critical code.

### When Not to Use Inline Functions

- **Large or Complex Functions**: Avoid inlining large or complex functions because it can lead to code bloat and potentially degrade performance.
- **Recursive Functions**: Inline functions should not be recursive, as inlining a recursive function would result in infinite code expansion.

### Summary

An **inline function** is a function for which the compiler attempts to replace the function call with the function code itself, thus eliminating the overhead of a function call. Use inline functions for small, frequently called functions to improve performance, but be cautious about code bloat and only use them when appropriate. Remember that the `inline` keyword is merely a suggestion to the compiler, which may choose not to inline the function depending on its optimization strategies.
